   @Summary
     This is the generated driver implementation file for the CWG1 driver using PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs
 
   @Description
     This source file provides implementations for driver APIs for CWG1.
     Generation Information :
         Product Revision  :  PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs - 1.65.2
         Device            :  PIC16F18857
         Driver Version    :  2.01
     The generated drivers are tested against the following:
         Compiler          :  XC8 1.45 or later
         MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 4.15
